  &DigitalOcean is one of the fastest growing cloud providers in the market. It provides realiable, performant and easy to use core cloud products to enable its customers to achieve their goals. I joined as DigitalOcean was close to 300 people with an engineering team nearing 100 and worked remotely for 3 months before moving to New York, NY. I'm part of the former Customer Experience team which has now been refocused to Accounts \& Productivity Tools. If you've ever signed up for DigitalOcean and used any service, you've experienced some of the work this team has contributed to the platform.

I played the role of Iteration Manager for a team distributed across 3 locations with 3 timezones. I also acted as a Tech Lead on the same team with development teams ranging from 8 people to 15 people in each location. More recently, after transfering to San Francisco, I've been acting as lead developer in a small lean experimentation team responsible to validate or invalidate business ideas. The team has morphed over time from a 4 people team to a 12 people team with 4 developers. I have also been heavily involved in the recruiting process at ThoughtWorks participating in both a large quantity of code reviews as well as phone interviews and in person interviews both for consulting skills as well technical and programming skills.
