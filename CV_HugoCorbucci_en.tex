  \emph{Current} & \textsc{Agilbits} - founder\\
  \textsc{Mar 2008}& \emph{Software Developer and Agile Consultant}\\
  &\\
  &Agilbits was created
  to supply needs of the Brazilian market in training, coaching as
  well as development of high quality software. I acted as the
  company administrator as well as software developer, consultant
  and coach.
  From the wide variety of projects developed, we had several
  experiences with Ruby on Rails from very simple content management
  systems up to image processing and submission systems.
  We also experiences with Java where I acted as member of a 3-5
  people team that led an exploration phase development up to a
  full-featured product running over 25 iterations. The project is a
  desktop application based on Eclipse's Rich Client Platform and
  reached over 40000 lines of production code and 45000 lines of
  automated tests.

  \emph{Current} & \textsc{AgilCoop} consultant\\
  \textsc{Jun 2007}& \emph{Instructor and Coach}\\
  &\\
  &AgilCoop was founded by professors,
  students, and former students of the University of São Paulo (USP)
  to foster and spread the values and principles of agile software
  development in Brazil. I acted as an instructor during the summer
  courses on classes such as ``Introduction to Agile Methods'',
  ``Quality Software Development through Automated Tests'' and
  ``eXtreme Programming Lab'' in São Paulo, São Carlos and Salvador.
  I also worked as coach on several projects in the academia
  and in the industry. AgilCoop is also responsible for organizing
  the ``Agile Meeting'' (\emph{Encontro Ágil}), of which I was a
  co-organizer in 2008, 2009 and 2010. It is a local
  event aimed for people new to Agile methods looking for contacts
  with more experienced people.

  & Following Agile Brazil 2010' success, another committee was formed
  to produce Agile Brazil 2011 in Fortaleza, Ceará. I assumed the work
  of program chair along with several other roles related to
  maintaining the website and submission system. The conference
  received 195 submissions from which around 65 were selected. I
  evolved with Danilo \textsc{Sato} the submission system in Ruby on
  Rails to include registration systems and improve it for the conference.

  &At Agile 2009, about 8 Brazilians got together and
  decided to run a country-wide conference about Agile methods in
  Brazil. I acted as an organizing committee member from the start, helping to form the
  15 people committee, planning and implementing the marketing
  strategy, sponsoring contact and program of the conference. In
  June 2010, the conference received over 800 attendees which
  submitted over 150 proposals from which around 40 were selected. I
  worked with Danilo \textsc{Sato} to develop the submission system in Ruby on
  Rails.
